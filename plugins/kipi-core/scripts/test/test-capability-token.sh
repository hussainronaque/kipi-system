# Every assertion is written so a broken implementation goes RED:
#  - consume is proven by a SECOND check failing (if delete were skipped, green)
#  - expiry is proven by an expired token being rejected (if ignored, green)
#  - atomicity is proven by exactly ONE of two racing consumers winning
# This is the fable-discipline rule: a check you have never seen fail is not a
# check. These have been seen to fail against deliberately broken inputs.
