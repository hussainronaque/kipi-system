# Build-Craft Pre-Done Checklist

Copy this into the task. Check each box before claiming done. Skip a box only
with a one-line reason next to it.

## Before editing
- [ ] Read the target file this session (not assumed from memory)
- [ ] Grepped the real schema / call-sites the change depends on
- [ ] Re-read exact column/field/API names instead of guessing them

## While building
- [ ] New dependency: declared and pinned in the manifest, same edit
- [ ] Degenerate cases defined: empty / single / disconnected / non-converging
- [ ] Persisted external input is validated before it is stored
- [ ] Mutations of the shared resource go through one writer, not many
- [ ] Why-comments encode the constraint + the named scar, not the "what"

## Verification (ran, not assumed)
- [ ] Reproducer runs against a temp/copy resource or :memory:, never live
- [ ] Negative self-test: a corrupted input makes the gate FAIL (no rubber stamp)
- [ ] Re-ran after the fix and saw green; pasted the command and the result
- [ ] Grepped every call-site the change had to reach; all covered
- [ ] Guard test proves no caller bypasses the single-writer (if applicable)

## Communication
- [ ] Terse mid-task; one `**Verification (ran, not assumed):**` block at the seam
- [ ] Options named + pick marked when a real choice existed
- [ ] No em-dashes in narration

Bypass the paired hook on a specific file with `# build-craft-lint-skip`.
