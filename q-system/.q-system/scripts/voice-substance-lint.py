voice-substance-lint.py - Positive-pattern voice enforcement.

The voice-lint catches deterministic AI fingerprints (banned words, em dashes,
rule-of-three, etc.). Those are what NOT to do. This script catches the
absence of what TO do: the cadence-without-substance failure mode.

A draft passes voice-lint if it avoids the banned patterns. But a draft can
have the SHAPE of voice (short declaratives, contrast pairs) without any
specific anchor and still read as AI cadence. That's the gap.

This script enforces presence of at least one anchor across three categories
for any prose over 200 words:

  1. WITNESS pattern: "I built", "I shipped", "I watched", "I ran", "I tested",
     "I engaged", "I wanted to", "I have been", "At [Company]", etc.
  2. SPECIFIC NAMED ENTITY: a proper noun that is dated or has context
     (e.g., "Google", "Meta", "Q3 2024", "iOS 17", "claudedaddy")
  3. CONCRETE NUMBER: a number tied to a real-world observation
     ($2k, 60 tools, 4 teams, 30 hours, 87%, etc.)

If the draft has ZERO of the three, it fires. Below 200 words the rule is
softer: requires at least 1 of the 3 above 80 words.

Stdlib only.

Usage:
    python3 voice-substance-lint.py <file_path>

Exit codes:
    0 = clean (has substance)
    2 = violation (cadence-without-substance pattern detected)

Override:
    Add `<!-- voice-lint-skip -->` anywhere in the file to bypass.
